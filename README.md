# FanduelAlgorithm
Generates Rosters that are optimized for projected points while still within salary cap.

This is a program designed to import a spreadsheet workbook of players, salaries, and projected points of 
various players, and then bruteforce every possible fantasy football roster checking to make sure the
teams are optimized for highest projected points while remaining at or below the salary cap. It is written
in a C# form based application, and there is an accompanying excel spreadsheet that needs to be imported
for the program to work.
